# Jitter file for simulation can be generated using this very simple one-liner:
# (mind that generated file '/tmp/random.txt' should match the value
# set for HDL parameter 'simtrng' in file hdl/ecc_customize.vhd)
#Â Value 128 MiB below (arbitratry large) designates the number of
# values generated, so be sure to generate enough of these for your
# own simulation requirements to avoid starving of the TRNG (reaching
# the end of file will make the simulation stop)
od -t u1 -w1 -v /dev/urandom | awk '{print $2}' | head -$((128*1024*1024)) > /tmp/random.txt
#  ('-t u1' tells od to format its output as one unsigned byte
#   '-w1' tells od to output one byte per line
#   '-v' tells od not to suppress lines, which otherwise are replaced with *)
