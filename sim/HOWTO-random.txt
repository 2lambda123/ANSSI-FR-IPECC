# You can use the following simple one-liner (at least on a Unix-like
# system) to generate the input file that will replace the physical
# TRNG as "random" input source in the simulation testbench:
od -t u1 -w1 -v /dev/urandom | awk '{print $2}' | head -$((128*1024*1024)) > /tmp/random.txt

# Mind that generated file ("/tmp/random.txt" above is just an example)
# should match the value set for HDL parameter 'simtrngfile' in file
# hdl/ecc_customize.vhd.
# Value 128 Meg above is also quite arbitratry and denotes the number
# of values that will be generated. Be sure to generate enough of
# these for your own simulation requirements to avoid starving of the
# HDL process replacing the TRNG (reaching the end of file will make
# the simulation stop).
